This folder should contain the dataset.
Each folder in this folder should contain the filtered images for each target. 
The folder name should be the galaxy name, and inside should be FITS files.
Each FITS file should be named only with its filter; for example, inside a folder 'NGC5457' might be 'B.fits' 'V.fits' and so on.
